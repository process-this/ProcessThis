## Amendments to ground rules

Here will be a place where we can propose new ground rules, I think that the voting system that we agreed on is how we are going to proceed.   


## New Rule Suggestions 

hold a quick 5 minute "scrum" every every Monday, Wednesday, and a longer meeting on Friday/Weekend.  The scrums on Monday, Wednesday will just be quick updates where we can all quickly inform the team of our progress, any problems and to ask to support if needed.  I think the Friday meeting can be a logistical type meeting where we can plan out/ or decide on our next courses of action.
