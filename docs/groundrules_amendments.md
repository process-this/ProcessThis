## Amendments to ground rules

Here will be a place where we can propose new ground rules, I think that the voting system that we agreed on is how we are going to proceed.   
also if there are rules you would like to keep from the original document feel free to copy and paste them into here as well.

## New Rule Suggestions 

hold a quick 5 minute "scrum" every every Monday, Wednesday, and a longer meeting on Friday/Weekend.  The scrums on Monday, Wednesday will just be quick updates where we can all quickly inform the team of our progress, any problems and to ask to support if needed.  I think the Friday meeting can be a logistical type meeting where we can plan out/ or decide on our next courses of action.  @@

## New Rule Suggestion
In group planning meetigs, before you disagree withan idea we must first say why they idea could work. "I see that it's important to stay warm, but I think that lighting the house on fire would be detrimental in the long run."
